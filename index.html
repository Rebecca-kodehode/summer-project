        <h2>What Is Fourth Wing?</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Fourth Wing</em> is a fantasy novel by Rebecca Yarros set in a
          deadly war college where only the strongest survive. Students train to
          become dragon riders, and danger waits at every corner — from brutal
          training to deadly secrets. The story follows Violet Sorrengail, a
          girl who wasn’t meant to be a rider, as she battles fate, enemies, and
          even her own doubts.
